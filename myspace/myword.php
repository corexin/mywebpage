      <p>Some lesson need to be learned especially at workplace - <strong>never 
        accept something you are not cerain of how to do it - it will take longer and may cause mistake (you can be guided if possible), otherwise you will 
        have trouble. </strong>I am a stupid guy who dont have these kind of ability 
        to organize stuff, say no to people. that doesnt mean you dont obey command 
        from your manager, but you need protect yourself through some tactic, 
        so avoid giving yourself troubles.</p>
      <p>Comparing with techical stuff relationship is much harder topic, there 
        is chinese saying &quot;Xue Hao Shu Li Hua, Zou Bian Tian Xia Dou Bu Pa&quot;, 
        which is definitely not coming from mouth of chinese philosopher. Because 
        many traditional chinese phrase can last and be valid forever, as they 
        are philosophy, not just stupid sentence out of stupid people mouth. &quot;<strong>disaster 
        comes from mouth</strong>&quot; - words can kills a people, it also can 
        save people. that is power of words, so be careful of the words out of 
        your mouth. <strong>To a real friend, dont bloody say much junk, just 
        do something to show your friendship</strong>. I believe god knows everything, 
        so <strong>you do other people a favor not for reward. </strong>I think 
        those simplest property as a humanbeing are not fully understood by some 
        stupid people on the earth.</p>
