    <td align="left" valign="top"> <p>Java is object oriented, easy to learn, 
        platform independent programming language, comparing with C, it is advanced 
        language, dont worry about pointer, memory management. I did my Java 
        course in uni and we have learned some advanced data struction such as 
        thread, Observer..., dont have a good memory.</p>
      <p>When you start writing bigger C program, you will start miss Object Oriented 
        Language, cause every thing looks messy if you are not a good C programmer. 
        the code is very hard to maintain.</p>
      <p>Java makes more people become programmer - which is not good for us right? 
        where to find a IT job? </p>
      <p>I learned my Java programming in <a href="http://www.bond.edu.au" target="_blank">Bond 
        University</a> - a small beautiful Uni. I start from basic stuff which 
        at first I thought is quite hard as I was told by some friends. after 
        I took it, I found out it is just simple stuff same as basic programming 
        in C which seems much harder than java. </p>
      <p>Nowadays it seems not many people use C anymore, I still use C at workplace, 
        I found out the senior guys' C programming skill is really good, much 
        better than me actually. I like programming stuff why I can not be the 
        best, however I still on the track to improving myself, maybe one day 
        I will quit not now.</p>
