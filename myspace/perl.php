      <p>First time met Perl is at Uni, I have no idea what Perl doing and also 
        the regular expression made me a bit crazy - what is regular expression 
        for???</p>
      <p>What is Perl? - <strong>Practical Extraction and Report Language</strong>, 
        actually I got the its full name recently, before never thought about 
        it. it is something like java is java, C is C. most people dont ask what 
        is C standing for?</p>
      <p>At workplace I started using Perl, I haven't really mastered it, still 
        in the learning curve. what I found is that Perl is <strong>amazing, powerful, 
        super</strong> language at data processing as you can see from its full 
        name. The biggest convenience is coming from <strong>regular expression</strong>.</p>
      <p>In perl, you can write a piece of code to do something that the other 
        language can not compete with. of course shell script can do something 
        faster than perl, but if you need a bit logical, perl's advantage comes 
        out, because is programming language, shell script is just some kind of 
        tool box at some points.</p>
      <p>which language can realize the following code:</p>
      <p><strong>my i='a'; i++;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>while(&lt;&gt;){print ;}</strong></p>
      <p>LOL, confused? then you should start looking for some tutorial on the 
        internet to find out...</p>
      <p>beside those stuff you can not find in other language, Perl also provide 
        a large quantity of library to use. however I am not quite familar with 
        them. Just tried a bit before, for example using perl FTP module to get 
        file from FTP server, using DBI or .. to connect to database. Perl can 
        also be used as CGI in the web service. but I feel a bit inconvenient 
        to use it, so I use PHP instead - which you can simpily create &lt;?php 
        ...?&gt; tag and put whereover you want.</p>
      <p>if you search &quot;perl regular expression&quot; on google, you can 
        find a lot simple tutorials, after you read it and understand, you will 
        become Guru :) - <strong>which is definitely wrong.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Remember: No one is the best. </strong>self confidence is based 
        on knowledge. I dont acknowledge western style education at some points. 
        some ppl in my company they dont know what they are doing, but the way 
        they talk seems they know everything. <strong>stupid. </strong>I am just 
        on ther reverse side - I know something but I can not explain well, so 
        it seems I know nothing.</p>
      <p>Keep learning, some time I surfer internet and still find something new 
        for Perl I have never seen before.</p>
